# WellbeingPlus

## Description
WellbeingPlus is a Chrome extension designed to improve eye health and general well-being during screen time. The extension offers the following key functionalities:

- **Blink Tracking**: Monitors the user's blinking rate using the camera. If the blink rate falls below a specified threshold (e.g., 8 blinks per minute) for a defined period, a warning is displayed to remind the user to blink more frequently.

- **20/20/20 Rule Reminders**: Sends reminders every 20 minutes to encourage users to take a 20-second break and look at something 20 feet away. This helps reduce eye strain and promotes healthier screen time habits.

- **Custom Reminders**: Allows users to set personalized reminders for various activities (e.g., drinking water, taking breaks). Users can specify the reminder name and time interval, providing flexibility to suit individual needs.
